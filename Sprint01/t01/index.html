          The Tesseract is named for its cube-like appearance and is capable of controlling
          space itself, providing the user instant access to any location throughout the
          universe if used correctly. The unique element that composes the Tesseract has
          also been used to create advanced weaponry by races like the Humans.

          The Scepter was a weapon that utilized the yellow Mind Stone housed inside a blue
          computer module, which also masked the stone's presence. Stark originally saw the
          Stone as a power source, whereas once J.A.R.V.I.S. had the opportunity to study the
          stone he stated it was more akin to a very powerful computer.

          The Aether appears as a dark, red, viscous liquid. It acts as a symbiotic force,
          capable of being absorbed into the body of a living host, giving the user the
          ability to warp reality at will, granting that person immense strength, durability,
          powers, and subjective influence over the universe. Malekith planned to use the
          Aether's reality-bending abilities to cover all Nine Realms in darkness;

          The Power Stone is an incredible power source, it increases the user's physical abilities
          and allows it to manipulate energy, which, when used at full potential, has enough power
          to obliterate an entire planet when unleashed. This stone was sought by Thanos, who
          tasked Ronan the Accuser to acquire it from the dead planet of Morag, in exchange for
          destroying Xandar.

          The Eye of Agamotto is an ancient artifact, a pendant created by Agamotto, the first Sorcerer
          Supreme, presumably to contain and harness the power of the green Time Stone contained inside.
          After being stored for an unknown amount of time on a pedestal in Kamar-Taj, it was recently
          wielded by Doctor Stephen Strange, first to aid him in his learning of sorcery, then in his
          final fight against Kaecilius and Dormammu.

          According to Wong's ancient texts, the Soul Stone could prove to be the greatest
          threat out of all the Infinity Stones.[18] Gamora knew of the location of the Soul
          Stone from a map she found to its whereabouts (which she burnt) but kept
          this a secret from Thanos.
